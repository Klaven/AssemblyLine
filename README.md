# Assembly Line
Our goal is that Assembly line can lay the groudwork for modernizing your build and testing pipelines, regardless of your cloud, code or infra. Have you ever wanted to run the same pipeline to build your project, test your project or you know, lint it locally the same way your build server can?

This project is young and moving fast! Join in the discord and our office hours if you would like to help out!
