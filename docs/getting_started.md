# Getting Started

As assembly line is a brand new open source project if you would like to get involved I recomend you join the [discord](https://discord.gg/SaJFQ8V) server, this is also where the office hours are being held.

## Contributing
How to contribute? we follow the same workflow as [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/github-workflow/), while our project is in rust and not go, so you can skip those parts revolving around go, we follow the same workflow in general and is a great place to start.
